THEORY:
In any activity which requires routing and delivery, addressing schemes are of vital importance.
In data communications networks, it is the Network Layer’s task to ensure end-to-end packet
routing and delivery – meaning a source is able to reach and send messages to a particular
destination, and vice-versa. Different protocols, pertaining to different addressing schemes,
under the Network Layer are available.
Each of which consists of different features corresponding to different technologies involved in a
data network. Common data network protocols are tabulated below:
